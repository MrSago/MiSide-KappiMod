## Rng Patches

1. [ChipMiniGamePatch](./ChipMiniGamePatch.cs)

   Removes randomness from the chip mini-game by fixing start/end points.

2. [FixedItemSpawnPatch](./FixedItemSpawnPatch.cs)

   Set fixed item spawn positions in Chapter 2.

   > I don't know good spawn positions for better runs.

3. [GoodDummiesPatch](./GoodDummiesPatch.cs)

   Makes all dummies good, removing the RNG from mini-game. Just accept all dummies, regardless of their characteristics, such as emotions or red eyes.

4. [NoChibiDoorUnlockerPatch](./NoChibiDoorUnlockerPatch.cs)

   Unlocks the door without catching chibi guys. Just interact with the box that contains the chibis and the door will open.

5. [RingInstantReadyPatch](./RingInstantReadyPatch.cs)

   Skips the ring wait event and instantly makes the ring ready in Cappie chapter.

   > I don't know if this is needed in the mod, but I left it.
